# Back-end Review

## Overview
The back-end leverages Next.js API routes with PostgreSQL (via Drizzle ORM), Supabase for authentication and storage, Cohere for AI-powered chat, and Pinecone for vector embeddings. It handles user profiles, projects, file uploads, session management, and contextual chat responses based on user data.

## Architecture
- **Database**: Drizzle schema defines tables for sessions and files (with migration support for Supabase users), user_profiles (JSON fields for skills, education, work experience, hobbies), and user_projects (detailed project metadata).
- **API Routes**: Key routes include /api/chat (POST for streaming AI responses using Cohere), /api/auth/profile, /api/projects/[username], /api/session (management), /api/file-upload, /api/cron/cleanup-sessions, and others for user data seeding/updates.
- **Authentication**: Supabase integration via src/lib/supabase.ts (client/server), auth.ts for token handling, and useAuth hook.
- **AI and Chat**: Cohere 'command-r' model in chat route; builds system prompt from user profile/projects; supports streaming UI responses.
- **Session Management**: Custom src/lib/session-manager.ts; associates sessions/files with Supabase user IDs.
- **File Handling**: Uploads to Supabase storage; embeddings via custom-embedding.ts and Pinecone (src/lib/pinecone.ts), though chat currently uses direct context injection rather than RAG.
- **Other**: Cron jobs for session cleanup; seed-data route for sample population.

## Strengths
- Type-safe ORM (Drizzle) with inferred models for front-end integration.
- Seamless Supabase auth with gradual migration from session-based to user-based.
- Efficient chat implementation: Contextual prompts from DB data, streaming for real-time feel.
- Modular lib structure (auth, utils, userProfile) promotes maintainability.
- Logging in APIs aids debugging (e.g., chat request details).

## Potential Issues and Improvements
- **Security**: Input validation/sanitization needed in chat/profile APIs to prevent injection; implement auth middleware on protected routes; secure API keys (Cohere, Supabase, Pinecone) via env vars.
- **Data Modeling**: Heavy JSON use in user_profiles (e.g., education array) may complicate queries/updates; consider relational tables for scalability or full-text search.
- **Performance/Scalability**: No caching (e.g., Redis for profiles); index DB fields (userId, username); monitor Cohere token usage/costs for chat; enable RAG with Pinecone for better context retrieval if expanding beyond direct injection.
- **Error Handling**: Generic 500 errors; add structured logging (e.g., Sentry) and user-friendly messages; handle streaming failures gracefully.
- **Testing**: Lacking API/DB tests; add integration tests for chat flows and auth.
- **Dependencies**: Update Cohere SDK; ensure compatibility with Next.js runtime ('nodejs'); review cron scheduling for reliability.

## Conclusion
Well-structured back-end supporting interactive portfolio features. Prioritize security hardening, performance optimizations, and testing for robust production deployment.
